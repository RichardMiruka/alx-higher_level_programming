# Python - Everything is object

# Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? 

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>> 
OK. But what about this?

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>>
