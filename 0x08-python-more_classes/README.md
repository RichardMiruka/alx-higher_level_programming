# Python - More Classes and Objects

![](https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/12985class-object-featured-image.png)

## Resources
* [Object Oriented Programming](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/M-MFweENpRdEfRto_Gzlvg) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/_Awd8Gn4SBdq2FRd_bY8KA) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
* [Class and Instance Attributes](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/SGQIevRxW6lTgr4jGDzXbw)
* [classmethods and staticmethods](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Ij1EnTg02gtIknOkNv4xGA)
* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/xjpk-jUNe0uGEzcNXbwIHQ) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
* [str vs repr](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/iu1ILT-t6FMuZvk7vRvfuQ)
